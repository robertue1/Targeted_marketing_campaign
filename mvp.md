# Targeted OOH ads for EV owners in Washington State

The analysis for this project has been centered on the most populous counties, and also the share % of EVs versus fossil fueled vehicles.

A more detailed analysis of these 5 counties is included below:

Then, focusing in Snohomish County, we can see the distribution of the share of the market of EVs.

Something that can change or improve, is the share of the market, by brand and by zip code in Snohomish County.

# Proposed solution path, risks and assumptions

For the project at hand, clustering should be used to create services tailored to the needs of clients in the different groups. 
To create the different categories, factors as brand market share, average of the year of production of vehicles, and median household income of the county, would be used. 

Risks:
 * By trying to better serve the most popular brands of vehicles, we could be missing out in the smaller niche that the underdogs could offer. 
 * By having to create too many different designs, we may defeat the purpose of the increase in revenue from targeted billboards. 
 * Changes in the market that can cause our clusters to be outdated.

Assumptions:
* EV owners are actually living in their registered addresses. 
* Due to the significantly lower population density in Snohomish (compared to King county - even though they have comparable areas), it is more likely that an EV owner, will live in a single-family home.

# Measure of success of the solution. 

Would this be mainly focus on the business side or are we gonna consider possible technical aspects of the 'future implementation' of the clustering algorithm?
