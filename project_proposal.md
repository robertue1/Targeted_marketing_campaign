# Targeted marketing campaign for EVSOLAR in Washington State.

## Roberto Linares

ElectricNow is a company in the solar energy market, based in California. After heavily investing on a marketing campaign, they have experienced a rapid growth in the number of sales of their Level 2 EV At-Home Charging Station. 

As their sales and the customer satisfaction confirm, the company has a great product offer, because of that, they have decided to expand their operations to Washington state, but in this case, they want **US** to use the publicly available electric vehicle data, to help them determine which cars should be featured in their billboards, in different locations of the state. 


# Need:

For this project, the idea will be to determine which EV brands are the most popular, in determined counties of Washington State, to be able to create targeted marketing campaigns. Approching the marketing strategy using targets, will help ElectricNow decrease their Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), thus, increasing their profitability. 

# Data Description:

To tackle this project, data from the electric vehicle population provided by the Washington state will be used. 
The features of the data include specific information about the vehicle, like brand, year, model, and also, geographic data of the owner. 

# Tools:

Google Sheets will be use for data exploration, cleaning and aggreation, while Tableu will be use for visualizations. 


# MVP Goal:

The minimun goal will be to provide a list of the 2 most popular EV brands, for the top 3 counties with most EV's registered.
